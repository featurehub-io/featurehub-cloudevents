= Kinesis Cloud Events support

This library supports encoding and decoding messages for Kinesis for Cloud Events in the same
basic format/structure as other SDKs. It has a KinesisMessageFactory that you can use to create a `PutRecordRequest.Builder`
and one which reads `KinesisClientRecord`.

Kinesis only supports a binary data packet, it does not support headers, so all CloudEvents are sent as structured
messages, even if you use writeBinary.
