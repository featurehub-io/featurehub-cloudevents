= FeatureHub Cloud Events

This repository stores various Cloud Events libraries either long term or before they find their final
resting place in their final location (which would generally be https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-java/)

Typically a protocol binding will go through specification + implementation and then be formally published.
We need a place where we can experiment with that while pushing on with support for various eventing platforms
as part of FeatureHub.

We support implementations for:

- Google Pub/Sub - based on the published beta spec from the original knative repository.
- NATS - based on the actual published spec
- Kinesis - there is no spec for this but Kinesis only supports structured Cloud Events so all events are written
using the JSON formatter that is part of the spec.
